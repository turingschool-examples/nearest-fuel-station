As a user
When I visit "/"
And I select "Turing" form the start location drop down (Note: Use the existing search form)
And I click "Find Nearest Station"
Then I should be on page "/search"
Then I should see the closest electric fuel station to me.

For that station I should see
- Name
- Address
- Fuel Type
- Access Times

I should also see:
- the distance of the nearest station (should be 0.1 miles)
- the travel time from Turing to that fuel station (should be 1 min)
- The direction instructions to get to that fuel station
  "Turn left onto Lawrence St Destination will be on the left"
